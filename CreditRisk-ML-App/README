Credit Risk Prediction App
A Machine Learning web app for real-time credit risk assessment.

Overview

This project develops an end-to-end Credit Risk Prediction system — from building and evaluating a machine learning model to deploying it as a fully functional, interactive web app.
It Covers:
* Model training using a Random Forest algorithm to classify applicants as good or bad credit risks
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering to handle mixed categorical–numerical data
* API development with FastAPI for real-time predictions
* Frontend interface with Streamlit for user-friendly input and instant results
* Automation through a .bat launcher and requirements.txt for reproducible setup
The goal was to simulate a real-world financial risk analysis workflow — turning a trained model into a deployable, accessible application that bridges data science and software engineering.

Model Details

Dataset: German Credit Dataset (UCI Repository) - Kaggle
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Preprocessing: ColumnTransformer combining StandardScaler and OneHotEncoder
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
Model Persistence: Exported with joblib for deployment
Output: Probability of bad credit risk + binary decision (Approved/Rejected)

Tech Stack:Python, scikit-learn, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Streamlit, Joblib, Virtual Environment (.venv), Batch Script (.bat)

How to Run:
Option 1 — Windows
Double-click on "run_creditrisk_app.bat" file.
It will:
Create and activate a virtual environment
Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
Start the FastAPI backend
Launch the Streamlit UI

Option 2 — Manual Setup

python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn Model_API:app --reload
streamlit run app_streamlit.py

The "requirements.txt" file is Uploaded for use.
